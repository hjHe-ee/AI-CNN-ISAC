# AI-CNN-ISAC
This module implements a CNN-based wireless positioning approach that directly learns the mapping from multi-base-station Channel State Information (CSI) to the user’s position. The system leverages the feature extraction capability of deep learning to achieve robust localization performance under multipath, non-line-of-sight (NLOS), and noise conditions.
